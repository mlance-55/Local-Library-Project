# Local Library

## Premise
Your neighborhood has decided to put together a local library where people can lend and borrow books. One of the most important features needed to organize this is a dashboard that will show which books are available, which are currently out, and other general statistics about the program.
Other people are taking care of the logistics and design, but they need you to build the algorithms.

## Context
This Local Library project was assigned to test our ability to build algorithms for large datasets. This was assigned to tie together the following learning objectives:

* Using Visual Studio Code as a text editor
* Differentiating between the three most common JavaScript error types
* Solving bugs by using error messages
* Differentiating between let, const, and var, and using each appropriately
* Creating an array from a string based on particular criteria and joining arrays into strings
* Writing strings that embed expressions using template literals
* Accessing all the values and keys of an object
* Using find(), filter(), and/or map() to solve different problems
* Using sort() to sort arrays in various ways

The datasets, HTML, CSS, test files, and some javascript functions were provided.
